**Tech Stack Used:**

1. **React**: The core frontend library for building user interfaces. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable UI elements.

2. **Node.js**: Used on the backend to create a server for handling API requests and business logic.

3. **Express.js**: A web application framework for Node.js, providing robust routing and middleware capabilities for the backend.

4. **Nodemailer**: A Node.js module for sending email notifications. Used for sending email confirmations and notifications to users.

5. **Nodemailer-Express-Handlebars**: A package that integrates Handlebars templates with Nodemailer to generate and send HTML emails.

6. **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests from the React frontend to the Node.js backend.

**Design Practices:**

1. **Component-Based Architecture**: The project follows a component-based architecture where UI elements are encapsulated within reusable React components. This promotes modularity and maintainability.

2. **State Management (if applicable)**: Depending on the project's complexity, state management may be implemented using tools like React Context API or Redux to centralize and manage application state.

3. **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various screen sizes and devices.

4. **Environmental Configuration**: Sensitive information like email credentials and API keys is stored securely using environment variables to protect sensitive data.

**Other Notable Aspects:**

1. **Email Notifications**: The project leverages Nodemailer and Nodemailer-Express-Handlebars to send email notifications to users, enhancing user engagement and providing confirmation of actions.

2. **Form Handling**: The project includes form handling for user input. Data submitted via forms is processed on the server, demonstrating data validation and interaction with the backend.

Certainly! Here's a description of the directory structure for the "Customized SOP Generator" project, which combines React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend:

```

**Directory Structure Overview:**

- **`client/`**: This directory contains the React frontend of the project.

  - **`node_modules/`**: Dependencies installed by npm or yarn for the React frontend.

  - **`public/`**: Public assets like HTML templates, images, and the `index.html` file.

  - **`src/`**: Source code for the React frontend.

    - **`components/`**: Reusable React components used throughout the frontend.

    - **`App.js`**: The main component serving as the entry point for the React application.

    - **`index.js`**: The entry point for rendering the React app.

- **`server/`**: This directory contains the Node.js backend of the project.

  - **`node_modules/`**: Dependencies installed by npm or yarn for the Node.js backend.

  - **`app.js`**: The setup for the Express.js application.

  - **`server.js`**: The entry point for the Node.js server.

- **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories to ignore when using Git for version control.

- **`README.md`**: Project documentation that provides an overview and instructions for running and developing the project.

This directory structure is designed to keep the frontend and backend code well-organized and separate while allowing for a clear and modular project setup. It provides a foundation for building and maintaining the "Customized SOP Generator" project efficiently.

Setting up a development environment for the "Customized SOP Generator" React project is a crucial first step to start working on the project. Below are the steps to set up your development environment:

**1. Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager):**

- Node.js is required to run JavaScript on the server-side, and npm comes bundled with Node.js to manage project dependencies.

- Download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version of Node.js from the official website: [Node.js Downloads](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

- After installation, verify that Node.js and npm are correctly installed by running the following commands in your terminal:
  ```
  node -v
  npm -v
  ```
  You should see the versions of Node.js and npm displayed.

**2. Install Yarn (Optional):**

- While npm is the default package manager for Node.js, you can choose to use Yarn if you prefer. Yarn is a faster and more reliable alternative to npm.

- To install Yarn globally, run the following command:
  ```
  npm install -g yarn
  ```

**3. Clone the Project Repository:**

- Clone the "Customized SOP Generator" project repository from your version control system (e.g., Git, GitHub).

- Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository URL:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/akashpathak9587/customized-sop-generator.git
  ```

- Navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:
  ```
  cd customized-sop-generator
  ```

**4. Install Project Dependencies:**

- Inside the project directory, you will find two main subdirectories: `client` (React frontend) and `server` (Node.js backend).

- First, navigate to the `client` directory:

  ```
  cd client
  ```

- Run either `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the frontend project dependencies:

  ```
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  ```

- After the frontend dependencies are installed, navigate back to the project's root directory:

  ```
  cd ..
  ```

- Next, navigate to the `server` directory:

  ```
  cd server
  ```

- Run either `npm install` or `yarn install` to install the backend project dependencies:
  ```
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
  ```

**5. Configure Environment Variables (if needed):**

- Check if there are any environment variables that need to be set for your project, such as API keys or database connection strings.

- Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and set the required environment variables as key-value pairs. Example:

  ```
  DATABASE_URL=your-database-connection-string
  API_KEY=your-api-key
  ```

- Ensure that you do not commit sensitive information to version control by adding the `.env` file to your `.gitignore` file.

**6. Start the Development Servers:**

- In separate terminal windows, navigate to both the `client` and `server` directories and start the development servers:

  For the frontend (inside the `client` directory):

  ```
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

  For the backend (inside the `server` directory):

  ```
  npm start
  # or
  yarn start
  ```

- The development servers should start, and you can access the React app in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`. The backend server will run on a different port, usually `http://localhost:5000`.

**7. You're Ready to Develop!**

- You can now begin working on the "Customized SOP Generator" React project in your local development environment. Any changes you make to the code will be reflected in the running development server.

- Use the development server's hot-reloading feature to see immediate updates as you make changes to the React components or server code.

With these steps completed, your development environment is set up, and you can start coding, testing, and contributing to the "Customized SOP Generator" project. Happy coding! ðŸš€
