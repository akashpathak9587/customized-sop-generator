Certainly! Here's a list of the external dependencies and libraries used in the "Customized SOP Generator" project for both the client and server, along with brief explanations of why each dependency is necessary:

**Client Dependencies:**

1. **@testing-library/jest-dom (^5.17.0)**:

   - **Purpose**: This library provides custom jest matchers for working with the DOM. It's primarily used for testing React components to ensure they interact correctly with the DOM.
   - **Why**: Necessary for creating robust and reliable unit tests for the client-side React components.

2. **@testing-library/react (^13.4.0)**:

   - **Purpose**: This library provides utilities for testing React components, including rendering components and interacting with them in tests.
   - **Why**: Essential for writing and running tests for the React components in the project.

3. **@testing-library/user-event (^13.5.0)**:

   - **Purpose**: This library simulates user interactions with React components during testing, such as clicking, typing, and more.
   - **Why**: Necessary for creating realistic user interaction scenarios in React component tests.

4. **axios (^1.5.0)**:

   - **Purpose**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for making HTTP requests. It's used for sending requests to the server to fetch or submit data.
   - **Why**: Essential for handling API requests and communication between the React frontend and Node.js backend.

5. **react (^18.2.0)**:

   - **Purpose**: React is the core library for building user interfaces in the project. It provides the framework for creating reusable UI components.
   - **Why**: The fundamental library for building the client-side interface.

6. **react-dom (^18.2.0)**:

   - **Purpose**: React DOM is a package for rendering React components in the browser. It's used to render React components to the HTML DOM.
   - **Why**: Essential for rendering React components in the browser.

7. **react-scripts (5.0.1)**:

   - **Purpose**: React Scripts is a set of scripts and configurations for building and running React applications. It includes development and build tools.
   - **Why**: Provides the development environment and build process for the React application.

8. **web-vitals (^2.1.4)**:
   - **Purpose**: This library helps measure and report web vitals, which are key performance metrics for web applications.
   - **Why**: Useful for monitoring and optimizing the performance of the React application.

<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
